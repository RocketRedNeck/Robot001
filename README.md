# Robot001
Example for the Students

The code in this repository was started during a series of live tutorials on how to create basic robot software for FRC, with a focus on clean layout of constants, operator interfaces, subsystems, and motor control using the CTRE Talon SRX controllers.

This code will undergo a series of changes as mentors and students update it with lessons learned prior to build season.
